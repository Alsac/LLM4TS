# LLM4TS: Large Language Models for Time Series

</div>

This project collects the papers and codes of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs) for Time Series (TS). Hope this project can help you to understand the LLMs and FMs for TS.

## ü¶ô LLMs for Time Series

*After the success of BERT, GPT, and other LLMs in NLP, some researchers have proposed to apply LLMs to Time Series (TS) tasks. They fintune the LLMs on TS datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results.*

## üß± Foundation Models for Time Series

*Recently, some kinds of Foundation Models (FMs) for Time Series (TS) have been proposed. These FMs aims to learn the representation of Time Series from large datasets and then transfer the representation to downstream tasks. Compared with TS-LLMs, these methods do not depend on the pretrained LLMs.*
